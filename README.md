## Instructions

## Task/Requirement

In a CommonJS compatible module, create an interface that would return the square root of a magic number to an asynchronous callback function.

We need to use this HTTP service which must be called with two numbers to produce the magic number:
`http://apps.wavana.com/magicnumber?x=[any number]&y=[any number]`

Write a simple script to test this module.
